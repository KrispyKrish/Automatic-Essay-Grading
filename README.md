## Introduction
The goal of this project is to automate essay scoring using a dataset of pre-scored essays. The notebook covers all steps, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation. By leveraging machine learning models, the system predicts essay scores based on various linguistic and semantic features.

---

## Features
- Preprocessing of textual data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Exploration of essay length, vocabulary usage, and other linguistic attributes.
- Application of feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and word embeddings.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Visualization of model performance and interpretability of predictions.

---

## Requirements
The project uses Python and several libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Below is a list of required dependencies:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- spacy
- gensim

You can install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/automatic-essay-grading.git
   cd automatic-essay-grading
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Automatic_Essay_Grading.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment.

---

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook. Ensure it is in the expected format (e.g., a CSV file with columns for essays and scores).
2. Run the cells sequentially to perform the following:
   - Preprocessing and feature extraction
   - Model training and evaluation
3. Review the evaluation metrics and visualizations for insights into model performance.
4. Optionally, modify hyperparameters or models for further optimization.

## Dataset
The dataset should include:
- **Essays:** The text of the essays to be graded.
- **Scores:** The actual scores for the essays, used for training and evaluation.

Ensure the dataset is preprocessed (if necessary) before running the notebook.

---

## Results
The notebook outputs:
- Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R^2, etc.
- Visualizations of predicted vs. actual scores.
- Feature importance (if applicable to the model).

---

## Future Work
Potential improvements to the project include:
- Exploring advanced NLP techniques, such as transformers (e.g., BERT).
- Implementing a neural network for essay scoring.
- Enhancing interpretability of the grading process using SHAP or similar tools.
